# Data Cleaning in SQL
I retrieved data from Kaggle about Shark Tank (a popular investment show in the USA). After retrieving the data I analyzed the data in SQL to obtain some pertinent information about the deals in Shark Tank. 

**Disclaimer** : This project is a follow-along project from [Jatila Molegoda](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shark-tank-analysis-jatila-molegoda/?trackingId=1%2F97OxDhSXqus5yxAS8S9g%3D%3D)

## About the Project
- What is the total number of deals that have been made in all seasons of Shark Tank, and what is the average deal size in terms of investment amount per shark?
- Which industry has the highest success rate in getting a deal?
- What is the success rate of pitches that have multiple entrepreneurs versus pitches with a single entrepreneur, and is there a significant difference in the investment amount per shark between the two categories?
- How does the success rate of pitches vary by state, and which states have the highest success rates?
- Which shark has invested the most in total across all seasons?
